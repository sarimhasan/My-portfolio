# MY PORTFOLIO SITE

This is my portfolio site, where I showcase my projects and skills. This website is made using the Astro framework, tailwind for styling and a little bit of react for the contact form component

## What did I learned?

- You can't import an empty react component file, you first need to make and export a function or a component.
- flex directions
